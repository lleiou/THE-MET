This project will focus on the data set provided by The MET museum in NYC.

- [ ] Data Cleaning and data mining, find some useful pattern and some aspects worthy to be investigated.
- [ ] Data Visualization (would be better if it is interactive, like hovering to show the thumbnail, brief info of the artifact).
- [ ] Machine Learning, image recognition.
- [ ] Maybe something like a dashboard which user could input something and get the output they want...
- [ ] tbc
